CSE340 Project 1: Lexical Analysis



Due: July 14th, 2022 by 11:59 pm MST

The goal of this project is to give you hands-on experience with lexical analysis. You will extend the provided lexical analyzer to support more token types. The next section lists all new token types that you need to implement.


1. Token Types



Modify the lexer to support the following 3 token types:



REALNUM   = NUM DOT digit digit*
BASE08NUM = ((pdigit8 digit8*) + 0) (x) (08) BASE16NUM = ((pdigit16 digit16*) + 0) (x) (16)



Where



digit16  = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + A + B + C + D + E + F pdigit16 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + A + B + C + D + E + F digit    = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9
pdigit   = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 digit8   = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 pdigit8  = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7



Note that  NUM  and  DOT  are already defined in the lexer, but here are the regular expressions for the sake of completeness:


NUM = (pdigit digit*) + 0
DOT = '.'



Note that  DOT  is a single dot character, the quotes are used to avoid ambiguity.The list of valid tokens including the existing tokens in the code would be as follows:



IF WHILE DO THEN PRINT PLUS MINUS DIV MULT EQUAL COLON COMMA
SEMICOLON LBRAC RBRAC LPAREN RPAREN NOTEQUAL GREATER LESS
LTEQ GTEQ DOT NUM ID
REALNUM BASE08NUM BASE16NUM



This list should be used to determine the token if the input matches more than one regular expression.


Follow these steps:

Download the  lexer.cc ,  lexer.h ,  inputbuf.cc   and  inputbuf.h  files accompanying this project description. Note that these files might be a little different than the code you've seen in class or 
elsewhere.

Add your code to the files to support the token types listed in the 
previous section.

Compile your code using GCC compiler in Ubuntu 19.04 or higher . You will need to use the  g++  command to compile your code in a terminal window.

Note that you are required to compile and test your code in Ubuntu 19.04 or higher using the GCC compilers. You are free to use any IDE or text editor on any platform, however, using tools available in Ubuntu 19.04 g++ version 4.9 (or tools that you could install on Ububntu 19.04 could save time in the development/compile/test cycle. See next section for more details on how to compile using GCC.

Test your code to see if it passes the provided test cases. You will need to extract the test cases from the zip file and run the test script  test1.sh . More details on this in the next section.

Submit your code in canvas before the deadline:


For this project you  need to update lexer.cc and lexer.h. The updates that you need to do in lexer.h are minimal and are already implemented in the submission  website. So you do not  need to   upload the lexer.h file in  CANVAS. But you still do need to update lexer.h if you want to compile locally.


3.1 Compiling Code with GCC

You should compile your programs with the GCC compilers which are available in g++ 4.9 in Ubuntu 19.04. The GCC is a collection of compilers for many programming languages. There are separate commands for compiling C and C++ programs:

Use  gcc  command to compile C programs

Use  g++  to compile C++ programs

Here is an example of how to compile a simple C++ program:


$ g++ test_program.cpp


If the compilation is successful, gcc will generate an executable file named  a.out  in the same folder as the program. You can change the output file name by specifying the  -o  switch:


$ g++ test_program.cpp -o hello.out


To enable all warning messages of the GCC compiler, use the -Wall
switch:


$ g++ -Wall test_program.cpp -o hello.out


The same options can be used with  gcc  to compile C programs.



Compiling projects with multiple files

If your program is written in multiple source files that should be linked together, you can compile and link all files together with one command:


$ g++ file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp


Or you can compile them separately and then link:


$ g++ -c file1.cpp
$ g++ -c file2.cpp
$ g++ -c file3.cpp
$ g++ file1.o file2.o file3.oThe files with the  .o  extension are object files but are not executable. They are linked together with the last statement and the final executable will be  a.out .

NOTE: you can replace  g++  with  gcc  in all examples listed above to compile C programs.


3.2 Testing your code with I/O Redirection

Your programs should not explicitly open any file. You can only use the standard input e.g.  std::cin  in C++,  getchar() ,  scanf()  in C and standard output e.g.  std::cout  in C++,  putchar() ,  printf()  in C for
input/output.

However, this restriction does not limit our ability to feed input to the program from files nor does it mean that we cannot save the output of the program in a file. We use a technique called standard IO redirection to achieve this.

Suppose we have an executable program  a.out , we can run it by issuing the following command in a terminal (the dollar sign is not part of the command):

$ ./a.out


If the program expects any input, it waits for it to be typed on the keyboard and any output generated by the program will be displayed on the terminal screen.

Now to feed input to the program from a file, we can redirect the standard input to a file:


$ ./a.out < input_data.txt


Now, the program will not wait for keyboard input, but rather read its input from the specified file. We can redirect the output of the program as well:


$ ./a.out > output_file.txt


In this way, no output will be shown in the terminal window, but rather it will be saved to the specified file. Note that programs have access to another standard interface which is called standard error e.g. std::cerr  in C++,  fprintf(stderr, ...)  in C. Any such output is stilldisplayed on the terminal screen. However, it is possible to redirect standard error to a file as well, but we will not discuss that here.

Finally, it's possible to mix both into one command:


$ ./a.out < input_data.txt > output_file.txt


Which will redirect standard input and standard output to  input_data.txt
and  output_file.txt  respectively.

Now that we know how to use standard IO redirection, we are ready to test the program with test cases.



Test Cases

A test case is an input and output specification. For a given input there is an expected output. A test case for our purposes is usually represented by two files:

test_name.txt test_name.txt.expected

The input is given in  test_name.txt  and the expected output is given in 
test_name.txt.expected .

To test a program against a single test case, first we execute the program with the test input data:


$ ./a.out < test_name.txt > program_output.txt


The output generated by the program will be stored in  program_output.txt . To see if the program generated the expected output, we need to compare program_output.txt  and  test_name.txt.expected . We do that using a general
purpose tool called  diff :


$ diff -Bw program_output.txt test_name.txt.expected


The options  -Bw  tells  diff  to ignore whitespace differences between the two files. If the files are the same (ignoring the whitespace differences), we should see no output from  diff , otherwise,  diff  will
produce a report showing the differences between the two files.

We would simply consider the test passed if  diff  could not find any differences, otherwise we consider the test failed.Our grading system uses this method to test your submissions against multiple test cases. There is also a test script accompanying this project  test1.sh  which will make your life easier by testing your code
against multiple test cases with one command.

Here is how to use  test1.sh  to test your program:

Store the provided test cases zip file in the same folder as your project source files

Open a terminal window and navigate to your project folder using 
cd  command

Unzip the test archive using the  unzip  command:


$ unzip test_cases.zip


NOTE: the actual file name is probably different, you should replace  test_cases.zip  with the correct file name.

Store the  test1.sh  script in your project directory as well

Mark the script as executable once you download it:


$ chmod +x test1.sh


Compile your program. The test script assumes your executable is called  a.out

Run the script to test your code:


$ ./test1.sh


The output of the script should be self explanatory. To test your code after each change, you will just perform the last two steps afterwards.


4. Requirements



Here are the requirements of this project:

You should submit your code in CANVAS, no other submission forms will be accepted.

You should use C/C++, no other programming languages are allowed.You should familiarize yourself with the Ubuntu 19.04 environment and the GCC compiler. Programming assignments in this course might be very different from what you are used to in other classes.


5. Evaluation



The submissions are evaluated based on the automated test cases on the submission website. Your grade will be proportional to the number of test cases passing. If your code does not compile on the submission website, you will not receive any points.
Two ways to check your grade
Gradescope
Submit a zip file with all your code 
Make sure the zip file only has your code files and no other subfolders.
